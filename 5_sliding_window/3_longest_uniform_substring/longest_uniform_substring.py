'''
A Uniform substring is one in which all character are identical.
Given a string, determine the length of the longest uniform substring that can be formed by replacing 
up to k characters

Example:
    Input: s = "aabcdcca", k = 2
    Output: 5

Explanation:
    If we can only replace 2 characters, the longest uniform substring we can achieve is "ccccc",
    obtained by replace b and d with c
