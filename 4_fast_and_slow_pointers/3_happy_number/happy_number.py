In number theory, a happy number is defined as a number that, when repeatedly subjected
to the process of squaring its digits and summing those squares, eventually
leads to 1.

An unhappy number will never reach 1 during this process, and will
get stuck in an infinite loop.

Given an integer, determine if its a happy number.

Example:
    Input: n = 23
    Output: True
    Explanation: 2^3 + 3^2 = 13 --> 1^2 + 3^2 = 10 --> 1^2 + 0^2 = 1
