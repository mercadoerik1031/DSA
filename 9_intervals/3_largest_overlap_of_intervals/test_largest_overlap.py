'''
Given an array of intervals, determine the maximum number of intervals that overlap at any point.
Each interval is half-open, meaning it includes the start point but excludes the end point.

Example:
    Input: intervals = [[1, 3], [2, 6], [4, 8], [6, 7], [5, 7]]
    Output: 3

Constraints:
    - The input will contain ar least one interval
    - For every index i in the array. intervals[i].start < intervals[i].end
